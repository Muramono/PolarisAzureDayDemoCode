Demo Heat Sensor Code For Azure Day
This is a collection of demo code used during a summer internship at Polaris Inc. The goal was to research Azure Cloud Computting and showcase the capabilities. To do this code was created to read data from a heat sensor connected to an ardiuno and then send said data to an Azure IOT Hub. The data was then taken and sent to Power BI for data monitoring/analytics.
